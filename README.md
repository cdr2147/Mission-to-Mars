# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview
We created a functioning app to report on the latest NASA news and stats about Mars, but we want to add more polish to it. Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, we update the app by scraping full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate the additional images.

## Results
The results below are displayed on the app:

We can customize we additional stylings, such as the "Info" style Button and arrangement of the hemisphere photos:
